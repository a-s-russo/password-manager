# Password manager

A simple password manager with a GUI created in Python using [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

Inspired by the project for days 29-30 of the course: [100 Days of Python](https://100daysofpython.dev/).

## Running

To run the password manager application:
1. Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed on your computer.
2. Ensure the Python package [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) is also installed.
3. Save `main.py` and `logo.png` from this repository into the same folder on your computer.
4. Run `main.py`.

Saved passwords are stored in a `data.json` file in the same folder.

## Features

- Save email/username and passwords for websites
- Generate random passwords (and copy to the clipboard automatically)
- Search for existing entries
